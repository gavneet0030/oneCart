  <i>Understanding how real-world full-stack applications are designed, built, and executed.</i>
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 align="center">🎯 Purpose of This Repository</h2>

<p align="center">
  <b>oneCart</b> was created to move beyond isolated scripts and mini-projects
  and into the world of <b>real-world, system-level application development</b>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The primary goal of this project is to understand <b>how complete applications are built</b>,
  not just how individual features work in isolation.
</p>

<p align="center">
  This repository focuses on:
</p>

<p align="center">
  ✔ How frontend and backend responsibilities are separated<br/>
  ✔ How user actions translate into backend requests<br/>
  ✔ How data flows through different layers of the system<br/>
  ✔ How scalable and maintainable project structures are designed
</p>

<p align="center">
  It reflects a transition from <b>beginner-level coding</b> to
  <b>intermediate-level software engineering and system thinking</b>.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 align="center">📂 Project Overview</h2>

<p align="center">
  <b>oneCart</b> is structured as a <b>layered full-stack application</b>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Instead of placing all logic in a single place, the project is divided
  into clearly defined layers, each with a specific responsibility.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The repository contains:
</p>

<p align="center">
  • <b>frontend/</b> – Responsible for user interface, user interaction, and client-side logic<br/>
  • <b>backend/</b> – Responsible for request handling, application logic, and data processing
</p>

<p align="center">
  This separation makes the application easier to understand, debug,
  and extend as new features are added.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 align="center">🧱 How the Project Was Designed</h2>

<p align="center">
  The design of <b>oneCart</b> started with identifying
  <b>real-world application requirements</b>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Instead of writing code immediately, the project was first broken down into:
</p>

<p align="center">
  ✔ What the user sees (Frontend)<br/>
  ✔ What happens behind the scenes (Backend)<br/>
  ✔ How both layers communicate
</p>

<p align="center">
  This approach ensures that each part of the application
  has a <b>single, well-defined responsibility</b>.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 align="center">🔁 Frontend–Backend Interaction</h2>

<p align="center">
  The frontend acts as the <b>entry point</b> for user interaction.
</p>

<p align="center">
  When a user performs an action (such as submitting data or requesting information),
  the frontend:
</p>

<p align="center">
  1. Captures the user input<br/>
  2. Sends a request to the backend<br/>
  3. Waits for a response<br/>
  4. Updates the UI based on the result
</p>

<p align="center">
  The backend processes this request by:
</p>

<p align="center">
  1. Validating incoming data<br/>
  2. Applying application logic<br/>
  3. Preparing a response<br/>
  4. Sending the result back to the frontend
</p>

<p align="center">
  This clear request–response lifecycle is a core concept
  in modern full-stack development.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 align="center">🧠 System Architecture & Flowchart</h2>

<p align="center">
  To clearly visualize how the application works internally,
  a <b>flowchart-based system design</b> was created.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The flowchart represents the <b>complete execution lifecycle</b>
  of the application — from user action to final response.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/gavneet0030/oneCart/tree/main/flowchart" target="_blank">
    🔗 View Flowchart Folder
  </a>
</p>

<p align="center">
  The flowchart explains:
</p>

<p align="center">
  ✔ Application initialization<br/>
  ✔ User request handling<br/>
  ✔ Decision-making logic<br/>
  ✔ Backend processing steps<br/>
  ✔ Response generation and UI update
</p>

<p align="center">
  This diagram ensures the system is <b>understood conceptually</b>
  before being extended or optimized.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 align="center">🧠 Why the Flowchart Matters</h2>

<p align="center">
  The flowchart is not just documentation — it is a
  <b>design and thinking tool</b>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  It helps in:
</p>

<p align="center">
  ✔ Understanding system behavior without reading code<br/>
  ✔ Debugging logical issues<br/>
  ✔ Explaining the project during interviews<br/>
  ✔ Planning future enhancements
</p>

<p align="center">
  This reflects a <b>software engineering mindset</b>
  rather than a trial-and-error coding approach.
</p>

<h2 align="center">🚀 How to Run the Project</h2>

<p align="center">
  Clone the repository:
</p>

<p align="center">
  <code>git clone https://github.com/gavneet0030/oneCart.git</code>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Navigate into the project directory:
</p>

<p align="center">
  <code>cd oneCart</code>
</p>

<p align="center">
  The frontend and backend are run separately,
  following the instructions inside their respective folders.
</p>

<p align="center">
  This separation allows independent development and testing
  of both layers.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 align="center">📈 Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p align="center">
  By building <b>oneCart</b>, the following skills were developed:
</p>

<p align="center">
  ✔ End-to-end application thinking<br/>
  ✔ Frontend–backend communication concepts<br/>
  ✔ Layered system architecture<br/>
  ✔ Flowchart-driven system design<br/>
  ✔ Real-world project structuring
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 align="center">🔮 Future Enhancements</h2>

  Planned improvements include:
</p>

<p align="center">
  • Database integration for persistent data<br/>
  • Authentication and authorization<br/>
  • API optimization and validation<br/>
  • Deployment on cloud platforms<br/>
